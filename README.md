#### v1.0 is under construction here. If you'd like to help, [please!](https://github.com/noraesae/perfect-scrollbar/milestone/1)

## Intro

> I was once working on a personal project, and trying to find the jQuery
> scrollbar plugin that's *perfect*. But there was no *perfect* one. That's
> why I decided to make one.

And it's been several years. perfect-scrollbar is being maintained by lots of
[contributors](https://github.com/noraesae/perfect-scrollbar/graphs/contributors),
keen to make perfect-scrollbar perfect. To be honest, it's quite *perfect*
already.

### Then what does *perfect* mean?

*perfect* means...

* Full-stretched scrollbar customisation
* Responsive update according to DOM or attribute changes
* Effective scroll handling
* Pluggable scroll emulation

They all sounds cool, aren't they? If they are, I bet you love perfect-scrollbar!
